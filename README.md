Tools for Dungeon Masters

Objectives of this app:

    1. Create functionality for DMs to generate random treasure hoards at a single click using the DND 5e API.

    2. Create functionality for DMs to generate random NPCs(non-player characters) complete with names, race, occupation, disposition, quirks etc using Name APIs and my DataBase

    3. Handy extra tools on each page for rolling dice, tracking initiative, etc

    STRETCH GOALS:
        1. Incorporate an encounter calculator using the formulas in the Dungeon Master's guide.
